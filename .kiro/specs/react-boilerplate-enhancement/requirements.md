# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to fix critical test failures and enhance the React project boilerplate to make it a production-ready, comprehensive template that developers can confidently use for new projects. The enhanced boilerplate will serve as a high-quality starting point with working tests, proper error handling, modern development practices, and comprehensive documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer using this boilerplate, I want all tests to pass out of the box so that I can trust the codebase and build upon it with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm run test` THEN all existing tests SHALL pass without errors
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL have proper DOM environment setup with jsdom
3. WHEN tests access browser APIs THEN they SHALL use appropriate mocks for window, localStorage, and navigator
4. WHEN hook tests run THEN they SHALL have proper React Testing Library setup
5. WHEN service tests run THEN they SHALL mock external dependencies appropriately
6. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL provide clear, actionable feedback

### Requirement 2: Enhance Error Handling System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust error handling system with user-friendly notifications so that my application can gracefully handle and display errors to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly toast notifications
2. WHEN API errors happen THEN they SHALL be categorized by severity and handled appropriately
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN users SHALL see helpful offline/connectivity messages
4. WHEN validation errors happen THEN they SHALL be displayed inline with form fields
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged for debugging while showing safe messages to users

### Requirement 3: Implement Modern State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern state management patterns with proper TypeScript support so that I can manage application state efficiently and safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing API data THEN the system SHALL use proper loading, success, and error states
2. WHEN making API calls THEN they SHALL be cached and synchronized appropriately
3. WHEN state updates occur THEN they SHALL be type-safe and predictable
4. WHEN components need global state THEN they SHALL access it through well-defined hooks
5. WHEN state changes THEN components SHALL re-render efficiently without unnecessary updates

### Requirement 4: Add Comprehensive UI Component Library

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete set of accessible, well-tested UI components so that I can build interfaces quickly without reinventing common patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building forms THEN I SHALL have access to Input, Select, Checkbox, and Radio components
2. WHEN showing feedback THEN I SHALL have Toast, Alert, and Modal components available
3. WHEN displaying data THEN I SHALL have Table, Card, and List components
4. WHEN creating navigation THEN I SHALL have Button, Link, and Menu components
5. WHEN all components are used THEN they SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards
6. WHEN components are implemented THEN they SHALL have comprehensive TypeScript interfaces

### Requirement 5: Improve Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excellent development tooling and documentation so that I can be productive immediately and understand how to extend the boilerplate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start development THEN hot module replacement SHALL work seamlessly
2. WHEN I write code THEN TypeScript SHALL provide helpful type checking and autocomplete
3. WHEN I commit code THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL ensure code quality
4. WHEN I need guidance THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL be available
5. WHEN I want to see components THEN Storybook SHALL showcase all UI components
6. WHEN I run builds THEN they SHALL be optimized for production deployment

### Requirement 6: Add Authentication Flow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete authentication system with proper security practices so that I can implement user management features quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN JWT tokens SHALL be stored securely
2. WHEN tokens expire THEN users SHALL be redirected to login automatically
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN authentication headers SHALL be included automatically
4. WHEN users log out THEN all authentication data SHALL be cleared
5. WHEN routes require authentication THEN unauthorized users SHALL be redirected
6. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the UI SHALL update appropriately

### Requirement 7: Implement Form Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust form handling with validation so that I can create complex forms with proper user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forms are submitted THEN validation SHALL occur before API calls
2. WHEN validation fails THEN errors SHALL be displayed inline with relevant fields
3. WHEN forms are loading THEN submit buttons SHALL be disabled with loading indicators
4. WHEN forms have unsaved changes THEN users SHALL be warned before navigation
5. WHEN forms are complex THEN they SHALL support multi-step workflows
6. WHEN form data changes THEN it SHALL be type-safe and validated in real-time

### Requirement 8: Add Performance Optimizations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the boilerplate to follow performance best practices so that applications built with it are fast and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components render THEN they SHALL use React.memo where appropriate
2. WHEN routes are accessed THEN code SHALL be split and loaded lazily
3. WHEN images are used THEN they SHALL be optimized and lazy-loaded
4. WHEN bundles are built THEN they SHALL be analyzed and optimized
5. WHEN the app loads THEN critical resources SHALL be prioritized
6. WHEN users navigate THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and responsive

### Requirement 9: Enhance Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage and testing utilities so that I can maintain code quality as the project grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write components THEN testing utilities SHALL make it easy to test them
2. WHEN I test user interactions THEN proper event simulation SHALL be available
3. WHEN I test API calls THEN MSW SHALL provide realistic mocking
4. WHEN I run tests THEN coverage reports SHALL show areas needing attention
5. WHEN I test accessibility THEN automated a11y testing SHALL be included
6. WHEN tests run in CI THEN they SHALL be fast and reliable

### Requirement 10: Prepare for Distribution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily create new projects from this boilerplate so that I can start building applications immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria
